# Survival-Analysis-Project
End to End Survival Project

# Project Overview

In this project, we perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of customer subscription data from a digital product offering that
includes financial advisory services such as newsletters, webinars, and investment recommendations. The primary focus of this analysis
is to understand the dynamics of customer retention and attrition over time. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle (available here),
provides information on customer demographics, subscription details, and customer interactions with the companyâ€™s call center.
The analysis is structured around three key statistical methods:
1. Nonparametric Survival Analysis: This method will be employed to estimate the survival function, which represents the
probability that a customer will continue their subscription beyond a certain time point. The Kaplan-Meier estimator will be
used for this purpose, providing insights into the typical lifespan of a subscription.
2. Nonparametric Comparison of Groups: We will compare the survival functions across different customer segments, such as
demographic groups or subscription types. This comparison will help identify whether certain groups are more likely to cancel
their subscriptions than others.
3. Semi-parametric Cox Regression: To further explore the factors influencing customer attrition, we will apply Cox proportional hazards regression. This model will allow us to assess the impact of various covariates, such as age, gender, and product
type, on the risk of subscription cancellation.

The outcomes of this analysis will provide insights into customer behavior, which can be leveraged to enhance retention strategies and
optimize customer support operations.
